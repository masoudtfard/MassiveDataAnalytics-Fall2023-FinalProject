# Massive Data Analytics Course - Final Project - Fall 2023
## Sharif University of Technology
### Stream Processing

This homework analyzes both the Persian Users Tweets dataset and the Persian News dataset to uncover insights through various data analytics techniques. The analysis is divided into two key
sections:
### Section 1:
Evaluates the Persian User Tweets dataset by employing multiple methods. The tweets were categorized by class and category to determine distributions across the data. Additionally, user connectivity and interactions on the platform were analyzed by generating a user graph and simulating the Small World Phenomenon. This enabled the study of information diffusion patterns amongst users.
### Section 2:
Focuses on the Persian News dataset with the stipulation that data is continuously streaming over time. To replicate this real-time scenario, streaming analysis was carried out to
uncover trending news topics and stories emerging chronologically in the feed. By extracting and processing current trends, this analysis provides value in understanding news cycles.

The project aims to thoroughly analyze both textual datasets - user generated content in the tweets and professionally edited news articles - using appropriate techniques. The detailed methodology and results are discussed in the following sections.
